MAXI J1535-571 Power Spectral Density Continuum Fitting Summary
================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Model the continuum of the X-ray power spectral density using different approaches.

METHODOLOGY:
- Data: NICER X-ray timing data from MAXI J1535-571
- Analysis: Fitting relationships between log(frequency) and log(power)
- Models tested: Linear (power-law), 2nd order polynomial, 3rd order polynomial

RESULTS COMPARISON:
==================

LINEAR MODEL (Power-law: P(f) = A × f^α):
- Power-law index (α): -0.785 ± 0.061
- Normalization (A): 1.52 × 10⁻³
- R²: 0.815
- AIC: -149.6
- Interpretation: Simple red-noise spectrum typical of X-ray binaries

2ND ORDER POLYNOMIAL:
- Quadratic coefficient: 0.317 ± 0.122
- Linear coefficient: -0.809 ± 0.058
- Constant: -2.881 ± 0.036
- R²: 0.844 (+2.9% improvement over linear)
- AIC: -154.3 (better than linear)
- Interpretation: Captures slight curvature in the spectrum

3RD ORDER POLYNOMIAL (BEST MODEL):
- Cubic coefficient: 0.769 ± 0.258
- Quadratic coefficient: 0.410 ± 0.115
- Linear coefficient: -1.143 ± 0.124
- Constant: -2.863 ± 0.033
- R²: 0.876 (+6.1% improvement over linear)
- AIC: -161.1 (best model)
- Interpretation: Captures more complex spectral features

MODEL SELECTION CRITERIA:
========================
- AIC (Akaike Information Criterion): Lower values indicate better models
- BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion): Penalizes model complexity more heavily
- R²: Fraction of variance explained by the model

CONCLUSIONS:
============
1. The 3rd order polynomial provides the best fit (lowest AIC = -161.1)
2. There is significant improvement over a simple power-law model:
   - 6.1% increase in R² (0.815 → 0.876)
   - Substantially lower AIC (-149.6 → -161.1)
3. The polynomial models reveal spectral curvature not captured by a simple power-law
4. This suggests the continuum has more complex structure than a simple red-noise process

PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS:
=====================
- The deviation from a simple power-law suggests multiple physical processes
- Could indicate:
  * Transition between different variability regimes
  * Contribution from multiple emission components
  * Non-linear response in the accretion flow
  * Possible break or bend in the underlying power spectrum

TECHNICAL NOTES:
===============
- Analysis used 39 frequency bins for computational efficiency
- Time resolution: 0.1 seconds (dt = 0.1s)
- Power spectrum segment size: 8.0 seconds
- All fits performed in log-log space for better numerical stability
