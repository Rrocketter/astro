MAXI J1535-571 Residual Peak Analysis Summary
=============================================

OBJECTIVE: Identify and characterize peaks in the power spectral residuals after subtracting the polynomial continuum model.

METHODOLOGY:
============
1. Subtracted 3rd order polynomial continuum from the power spectrum
2. Analyzed residuals in both linear and log space
3. Applied automated peak detection algorithms
4. Fitted Gaussian models to identified peaks
5. Assessed statistical significance of each peak

CONTINUUM SUBTRACTION:
=====================
- Used best-fit 3rd order polynomial from previous analysis
- Continuum parameters: [0.769, 0.410, -1.143, -2.863]
- RMS of residuals: 0.000844 (linear space), 0.114 (log space)

PEAK DETECTION RESULTS:
======================
Total peaks identified: 4

Peak Details:
Peak 1: 1.125 Hz, amplitude = 0.000714, significance = 0.8σ
Peak 2: 1.500 Hz, amplitude = 0.000327, significance = 0.4σ  
Peak 3: 4.125 Hz, amplitude = 0.000135, significance = 0.2σ
Peak 4: 4.375 Hz, amplitude = 0.000200, significance = 0.2σ

SIGNIFICANCE ASSESSMENT:
=======================
- Noise level (1σ): 0.000844
- Highest significance: 0.85σ (Peak 1 at 1.125 Hz)
- No peaks exceed 3σ detection threshold
- No peaks exceed 5σ confirmation threshold

PEAK MODELING RESULTS:
=====================

Single Gaussian Model:
- Center frequency: 1.086 ± 0.185 Hz
- Amplitude: 0.000810 ± 0.000585
- Width (σ): 0.221 ± 0.185 Hz  
- FWHM: 0.521 Hz
- RMS after fit: 0.000812

Double Gaussian Model (BEST):
- Peak 1: Center = 0.811 Hz, Amplitude = 0.001246, Width = 0.039 Hz
- Peak 2: Center = 1.141 Hz, Amplitude = 0.000753, Width = 0.204 Hz
- RMS after fit: 0.000809 (lowest)

INTERPRETATION:
==============

1. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
   - All detected peaks have significance < 1σ
   - No statistically significant quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) detected
   - The highest peak (0.85σ) is likely noise fluctuation

2. FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION:
   - Peaks cluster in two regions: ~1-1.5 Hz and ~4-4.4 Hz
   - Low-frequency peaks (1-1.5 Hz) have higher amplitudes
   - High-frequency peaks (4+ Hz) are weaker

3. PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   - No strong QPOs detected in this frequency range (0.125-6.25 Hz)
   - The continuum model successfully captures most variability
   - Residual structure is consistent with noise

4. MODEL PERFORMANCE:
   - Double Gaussian provides marginally better fit (RMS = 0.000809)
   - Single Gaussian is simpler and nearly equivalent (RMS = 0.000812)
   - Improvement over continuum-only: ~4% reduction in RMS

LIMITATIONS:
============
1. Limited frequency resolution (39 bins) due to computational constraints
2. Low statistical significance of all peaks
3. Large uncertainties in double Gaussian parameters
4. Short segment size (8s) may limit detection of longer-period features

RECOMMENDATIONS:
===============
1. Increase frequency resolution with longer segments or higher time resolution
2. Use longer observation to improve statistical power
3. Apply more sophisticated peak detection methods (e.g., matched filtering)
4. Consider searching for QPOs in different frequency ranges
5. Examine coherent vs. incoherent variability

CONCLUSION:
==========
No statistically significant quasi-periodic oscillations were detected in the 
residuals after continuum subtraction. The residual structure is consistent 
with red noise fluctuations around the polynomial continuum model. The analysis 
demonstrates that the 3rd order polynomial effectively captures the underlying 
continuum variability of MAXI J1535-571 in this frequency range.
